Concept art of the main antagonist, a rogue AI named 'Warden'. Warden does not have a physical body. It manifests as a large, floating, abstract digital construct. Its face is a semi-humanoid mask formed from glitching red pixels and fragments of corrupted data. It is surrounded by a chaotic aura of red light and distorted code. The background is a dark, infinite digital void. Style: unsettling, abstract horror, cyberpunk, menacing.
