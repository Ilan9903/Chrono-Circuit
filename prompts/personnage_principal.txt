Full body character concept art of the main playable character for an escape game. A young male programmer in his late 20s, named Alex. He has a determined but slightly worried expression. He wears a simple grey hoodie, dark jeans, and sneakers. He is standing in a dark environment illuminated by floating, holographic user interface elements and lines of code around him. Style: realistic digital painting, detailed character design, inspired by games like 'Cyberpunk 2077' but more grounded and less augmented.
