Wide panoramic banner for a Steam store page, for the game 'Chrono-Circuit'. A vast digital landscape inspired by a computer's motherboard. There are floating islands made of server racks and CPUs, connected by bridges of light and flowing data streams. The sky is dark, filled with faint lines of code. The color scheme is predominantly dark blue, with accents of neon purple and cyan. The game logo is placed on the right side. No text other than the logo. Cyberpunk style, detailed, epic scale.
