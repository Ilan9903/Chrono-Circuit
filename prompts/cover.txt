Cinematic game cover art for 'Chrono-Circuit: The Turing Trap'. A character's silhouette seen from behind, his hand pressed against a transparent wall of cascading, glowing green and blue binary code. On the other side of the wall, a giant, ominous, red glowing AI eye is visible inside a complex server room architecture. The art style should be photorealistic with a strong cyberpunk and glitch aesthetic. The game title 'Chrono-Circuit' is displayed at the bottom in a modern, digital font. Dramatic lighting, high contrast, 4K resolution.
