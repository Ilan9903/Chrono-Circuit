UI design for a video game main menu. The background is a dark, slowly animating image of a computer motherboard with glowing circuits. In the center, the game logo 'Chrono-Circuit' is prominently displayed. Below the logo, there are clear, minimalist menu options: 'New Game', 'Load Game', 'Options', 'Quit'. The selected option glows with a bright blue light. The font is a clean, modern sans-serif like 'Roboto' or 'Montserrat'. A subtle, intermittent glitch effect runs across the screen. Overall aesthetic is clean, professional, and fits a sci-fi escape game.
