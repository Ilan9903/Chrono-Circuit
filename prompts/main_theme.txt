An instrumental main menu theme for a puzzle escape game with a computer/hacker theme. The style should be dark synthwave mixed with ambient electronic. A slow, mysterious arpeggiated synth line should be the main element, with deep bass pads underneath. Add subtle glitch sound effects and the sound of a distant hard drive working. The mood is tense and contemplative, with a growing sense of urgency. Loopable, 2 minutes long.
